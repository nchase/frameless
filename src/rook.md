<p>So yeah, those things. Those things among other things.</p>

I live and work a few blocks away from Washington DC as a senior software engineer.

Work-wise, I love systemic thinking, building great products, mentoring, and writing code.

-----

I'm an ex-academic &mdash; started a Master's program in an unrelated field after college
&mdash; at the time I thought I'd want an academic career &mdash;
didn't finish. I'm happy with not finishing.


I learned a lot about myself and a lot about the world in that time.

Teaching my own class with my own curriculum was awesome.

I still have a bit of a _taste_ for the academic stuff...

Basically I like to read. For me it all goes back to reading and writing.
Internalizing stuff and then synthesizing it.

I started working at a startup in Silver Spring about 3.5 years ago, then we got acquired.
I'm still at the same place and I still really enjoy my job.

-----

I'm a bit shy, but not terribly shy.

-----

I have a twin brother. We're identical twins, but pretty different.
It's interesting sometimes.

[m.ahfr.org](http://m.ahfr.org/) is a website that I really enjoyed building. It's [mostly] just a growing collection of things that I have found on the internet and liked.
